OpenElastic is founded on the premise that organizations today are built largely on legacy information systems that are unnecessarily causing massive drain on their budgets and radically increasing organizational friction.  We believe that cloud and serverless technologies are game-changers that will have a dramatic and measurable positive impact if implemented correctly.  The migration is not something that will happen overnight.  Much like the migration to the Internet itself, this is a journey that will take years.

We aim to be your partner in the journey, and to help you map out an overall strategy to identify the low-hanging fruit that will show the fastest return on investment.  Quick wins will fuel other projects that will decrease cost and increase organizational agility.
